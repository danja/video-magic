# Scrappy notes 2024-08-20

I got a Colab notebook to work on `src/video-magic_colab.ipynb`, with lots of manual intervention. It looks like it used all my free tier GPU supply before finishing, but bloody useless Google don't give any useful availability/limit/usage information (beyond saying "things might run for 12 hours").

As I've got this far on Colab I might as well continue and tidy up a bit. It might not be runnable without a pay-for tier (and I'm skint today), but a tidier version will be a more portable version.

First job is to use my Google Drive for all data storage. I just checked, there are libs to use it from HuggingFace spaces.

It's easy to mount in Colab, and having (intermediate) results persisted outside of Colab seems must-have.

My Google Drive, under `My Drive` in drive browser app,

[My Drive/colab-data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12gglcq7ha9x3a_Y-LDUFyLUx483R41oo?usp=sharing) shared.

Dir tree created -

`colab-data/video-magic/`, under that :

```
data
├── audio
│   ├── foaftalk-audio-orig-isolated.mp3
│   └── foaftalk-audio-orig.m4a
├── frames
├── input
│   ├── orig-vid-only.mp4
│   └── snippet.mp4
├── interpolated
├── output
└── upscaled
```

`MyDrive` mounted at `/content/drive` so `data` tree above is seen as :

```
/content/drive/MyDrive/colab-data/video-magic/data/
```

DO AUDIO ON BAD VID
