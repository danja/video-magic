**Improving the quality of a video recording**

_it seems like magic to me_

**tl;dr** : see [File List]()

**Status 2024-08-18** : halfway through (writing this up while things reinstall)

**Caveat** : my goal was to see what I could do with one specific recording without going to far down the rabbit hole. While I'm familiar with (conventional) audio techniques, video/image processing isn't something I've spent much time with, so most of this is from a perspective of learning as I go along, can no doubt be significantly improved on. But I think the overall workflow more or less makes sense.

### Background

A while ago [danbri](https://x.com/danbri) (/[danbri.org](https://danbri.org/)) asked me to see what I could do with an video of a presentation he & Edd _(TODO current link?)_ did about the [FOAF Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF) years ago. The a/v quality was terrible. I was reasonably confident I'd be able to improve the audio using conventional techniques, but this turned out to be far less successful than I thought. On the video side, I didn't have a clue at first.
